# Make Your Own App (course from EdX)

## Introduction
The goal is to create a chat application called **chatter|app**.
Similar to other chat applications, the app we are building allows the user to post messages in *different channels*. 
Each message will be displayed with the *corresponding username and time* the message was submitted. 
Additionally, there will be a *difference in the appearance* between the user's own messages and messages from other people.
